                    I was born in a suburb of Santa Barbara, CA called Goleta in 
                    1986. It is my opinion that there is no more hospitable climate 
                    for humans than the paradise of California's coastline. Any day
                    above 80&deg F was consider hot, and any day below 70&deg F was
                    considered cold. I am grateful to my parents for the thought and 
                    consideration they put into their family planning.

                    Unfortunately those plans were uprooted when my father was
                    diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1991. After a long battle with
                    the disease, he passed away in February 1993. I was six years old
                    at the time. Needless to say, this affected the rest of my life 
                    in a profound way. However, life does go on and the remainder of 
                    my childhood was spent doing well in school, bowling, and being 
                    sub-par at other sports.

                <p class="oddParagraph grid-item">
                    I started my first job as a porter at the local bowling center when 
                    I was 14. This job helped me learn fiscal and professional 
                    responsibility. I worked in various positions at the bowling center 
                    over the course of seven years, ultimately becoming the Front Desk 
                    night manager. Simultaneously, I went to three years of high school 
                    before testing out and acquiring my GED at 16.

                    The next fall, I began attending community college rather aimlessly. 
                    After several years of dabbling in various majors, I settled on 
                    obtaining an A.A. in Video Production in the spring of 2009. I moved
                    to North Hollywood, but couldn't find any work in the film industry
                    over the entire summer. A friend of mine was living in Las Vegas at 
                    time, so I moved to the dessert and began attending dealer school.

                    Shortly after moving to Las Vegas, I began my career as a 
                    table games dealer. I primarily dealt Craps, but I had 
                    learned Blackjack at dealer school as well. I aggressively 
                    pursued better dealing opportunities by transferring betweeen
                    properties and learning new games. As is common for table 
                    games dealers, I worked in two different casinos simultaneously 
                    for a several years.

                    It is my opinion that table games dealing is the best career
                    a person can have with no higher education required. The 
                    hourly pay is only slightly above minimum wage, but the tips
                    (called tokes in the industry) can bring a dealer's annual 
                    income well above the national median. Futhermore, table 
                    games dealers usually get a 20 minute break for every hour 
                    they spend on the table. This equates to spending a quarter 
                    of one's shift on break.
                </p>

                <p class="oddParagraph grid-item">
                    Despite dealing being a good job, there are a few aspects which
                    I disliked. Most notably were the shift hours. Since the table 
                    games industry is a 24 hour business, the shifts were split into 
                    three categories:
                    <ul style="display:block">
                        <li>Graveyard shift: 4:00 A.M. - Noon</li>
                        <li>Day shift: Noon - 8:00 P.M.</li>
                        <li>Swing shift: 8:00 P.M. - 4:00 A.M.</li>
                    </ul>
                    My personal preference was working Graveyard shift, but waking 
                    up at 2:30 A.M. wasn't always easy.

                    While I was working as a dealer, I came to the realization 
                    that I did not want to stay in that job for another 30 years. 
                    So, I decided to work one full-time dealing job at the MGM 
                    Grand and attend UNLV full-time to work toward my B.S. in 
                    Computer Science. I worked on this degree for four years 
                    (including the Covid-19 pandemic) until I graduated <i>Magna 
                    Cum Laude</i> in the Spring of 2021.
