                    I was born in a suburb of Santa Barbara, CA called Goleta in 
                    1986. It is my opinion that there is no more hospitable climate 
                    for humans than the paradise of California's coastline. Any day
                    above 80&deg F was consider hot, and any day below 70&deg F was
                    considered cold. I am grateful to my parents for the thought and 
                    consideration they put into their family planning.

                    Unfortunately, those plans were uprooted when my father was
                    diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1991. After a long battle with
                    the disease, he passed away in February 1993. I was six years old
                    at the time. Needless to say, this affected the rest of my life 
                    in a profound way. However, life does go on and the remainder of 
                    my childhood was spent doing well in school, bowling, and being 
                    sub-par at other sports.

                    I started my first job as a porter at the local bowling center when 
                    I was fourteen. This job helped me learn fiscal and professional 
                    responsibility. I worked in various positions at the bowling center 
                    over the course of seven years, ultimately becoming the Front Desk 
                    night manager. Simultaneously, I went to three years of high school 
                    before testing out and acquiring my GED at 16.

                    The next fall, I began attending community college aimlessly. 
                    After several years of dabbling in various majors, I settled on 
                    obtaining an A.A. in Video Production in the spring of 2009. I moved
                    to North Hollywood, but could not find any work in the film industry
                    over the entire summer. A friend of mine was living in Las Vegas at 
                    time, so I moved to the desert and began attending dealer school.

                    Shortly after moving to Las Vegas, I began my career as a 
                    table games dealer. I primarily dealt Craps, but I had 
                    learned Blackjack at dealer school as well. I aggressively 
                    pursued better dealing opportunities by transferring between
                    properties and learning new games. As is common for table 
                    games dealers, I worked in two different casinos simultaneously 
                    for a five years.

                    It is my opinion that table games dealing is the best career
                    a person can have with no higher education required. The 
                    hourly pay is only slightly above minimum wage, but the tips
                    (Called tokes in the industry) can bring a dealer's annual 
                    income well above the national median. Furthermore, table 
                    games dealers usually get a 20-minute break for every hour 
                    they spend on the table. This equates to spending a quarter 
                    of one's shift on break.
                </p>

                <p class="oddParagraph grid-item">
                    Despite dealing being an excellent job, there are a few aspects which
                    I disliked. Most notably were the shift hours. Since the table 
                    games industry is a 24-hour business, the shifts were split into 
                    three categories: Graveyard, Days, and Swing. My personal 
                    preference was working Graveyard shift, but waking up at 2:30 A.M. 
                    was not always easy.

                    While I was working as a dealer, I came to the realization 
                    that I did not want to stay in that job for another 30 years. 
                    So, I decided to work one full-time dealing job at the MGM 
                    Grand and attend UNLV full-time to obtain my B.S. in 
                    Computer Science. I worked on this degree for four years 
                    (Including during the Covid-19 pandemic) until I graduated 
                    <i>Magna Cum Laude</i> in the Spring of 2021.

                    The Computer Science curriculum at UNLV has a strong focus 
                    on the theoretical limitations of computers. Algorithm 
                    Analysis, Automata Theory, and Computer Organization delved 
                    into what problems computers can and cannot solve. I found 
                    the theoretical facets of the discipline fascinating, but 
                    I had hoped for more practical learning from the university.

                    I am a bit embarrassed to admit that I did not use the most 
                    up-to-date tools for software development when I was attending 
                    UNLV. I did all my coding assignments using Emacs while 
                    SSH'd onto the school server. I even did all my x86 Assembly 
                    assignments in the basic text editor (Notepad). Only one course 
                    even introduced the concept of version control and the software 
                    development life cycle.

                    While I was attending UNLV, I was still dealing full-time at 
                    the MGM Grand. In my third year, MGM Resorts had a presentation 
                    at UNLV to recruit software engineers for their summer internship 
                    program. Unfortunately, I could not take on the internship since I 
                    was already working for the company, but I did introduce myself to 
                    the recruiter and managers. During my final semester, I reached 
                    out via email to one of the managers I had met. We began the process 
                    of transferring from the Table Games department to the corporate 
                    software development team.

                    I was amazed at how little my education prepared me for the 
                    real world of software development. Not only did I have to 
                    familiarize  myself with the company specific tools and procedures, 
                    but I also had to quickly learn some standard tools of the trade, 
                    like GitHub, Visual Studio, and Kanban boards.
                    I am proud of how much I have learned since starting as a 
                    software engineer, and I am excited for all the new things I 
                    will learn as I continue my professional development.
