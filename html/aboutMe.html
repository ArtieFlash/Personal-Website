                    I was born in a suburb of Santa Barbara, CA called Goleta in 
                    1986. It is my opinion that there is no more hospitable climate 
                    for humans than the paradise of California's coastline. Any day
                    above 80&deg F was consider hot, and any day below 70&deg F was
                    considered cold. I am grateful to my parents for the thought and 
                    consideration they put into their family planning.

                    Unfortunately those plans were uprooted when my father was
                    diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1991. After a long battle with
                    the disease, he passed away in February 1993. I was six years old
                    at the time.
                    Needless to say, this affected the rest of my life in a profound
                    way. However, life does go on and the remainder of my childhood was
                    spent doing well in school, bowling, and being sub-par at other 
                    sports.
