                    I was born in a suburb of Santa Barbara, CA called Goleta in 
                    1986. It is my opinion that there is no more hospitable climate 
                    for humans than the paradise of California's coastline. Any day
                    above 80&deg F was consider hot, and any day below 70&deg F was
                    considered cold. I am grateful to my parents for the thought and 
                    consideration they put into their family planning.

                    Unfortunately those plans were uprooted when my father was
                    diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1991. After a long battle with
                    the disease, he passed away in February 1993. I was six years old
                    at the time. Needless to say, this affected the rest of my life 
                    in a profound way. However, life does go on and the remainder of 
                    my childhood was spent doing well in school, bowling, and being 
                    sub-par at other sports.

                    I started my first job as a porter at the local bowling center when 
                    I was 14. This job helped me learn fiscal and professional 
                    responsibility. I worked in various positions at the bowling center 
                    over the course of seven years, ultimately becoming the Front Desk 
                    night manager. Simultaneously, I went to three years of high school 
                    before testing out and acquiring my GED at 16.

                    The next fall, I began attending community college rather aimlessly. 
                    After several years of dabbling in various majors, I settled on 
                    obtaining an A.A. in Video Production in the spring of 2009. I moved
                    to North Hollywood, but couldn't find any work in the film industry
                    over the entire summer. A friend of mine was living in Las Vegas at 
                    time, so I moved to the dessert and began attending dealer school.

                    Shortly after moving to Las Vegas, I began my career as a 
                    table games dealer. I primarily dealt Craps, but I had 
                    learned Blackjack at dealer school as well. I aggressively 
                    pursued better dealing opportunities by transferring betweeen
                    properties and learning new games. As is common for table 
                    games dealers, I worked at two different casinos simultaneously 
                    for a several years.
